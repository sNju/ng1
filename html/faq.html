                   <h5>What is Shadow / Shadowing?</h5>
                   <p>We have introduced concept of "Shadow / Shadowing", wherein you shadow your favorite party-spots, Artists, Bands, DJs.</p>

                   <h5>What is Crowd Quotient?</h5>
                   <p>Gives the GP user an idea about the type of crowd that may be expected at a particular party-spot. The crowd quotient is on a scale of 1 to 5. 1 being the lowest on the rating/s.</p>

                   <h5>What is Pinned?</h5>
                   <p>"Pinned" is when you save/ mark things that interest GP users in the Goparties App. The Pinned material can be used for future reference.  The following activities can be Pinned: (a) Parties; (b) Deals; (c) Launched Works uploaded by GP Businesses.</p>

                   <h5>What are GP Coins?</h5>
                   <p>This is the new parties' currency, called GP Coins.</p>
                   <p>There are various methods and ways to earn the GP coins and spending GP coins can get you a lot of stuff and deals from the exclusive Goparties 'party store'.</p>
                   <p>
                    <strong>Method To Spend GP Coins</strong><br>         
                    The Partymons would be given invite to special exclusive parties, deals, merchandise on the Party Store promoted by GoParties In-App, which can be bought by the Party Mons through the Party Store.
                  </p>


                  <h5>What is Goparties Party Store?</h5>
                  <p>The exclusive Party Store would display Parties/ Deals which can be claimed by spending GP Coins.</p>

                  <h5>What are Partymons?</h5>
                  <p>The end-user when accessing the home-page of the app for the first-time would get a pop to chose - what is your Partymon? Upon chosing the Partymon, the Partymon would become the profile snap of the GP user.</p>
                  <p>The GP user would have an option to edit the Partymon from Accounts. Also, if the  GP user does not want a Partymon, then he can choose an image of choice.</p>

                  <h5>What is POA: Pay On Arrival?</h5>
                  <p>This is a very special feature exclusively for the GP users.</p>
                  <p>"POA Mode" is a mode of payment where you make a booking online and the actual payment towards the booking has to be made at the entry-point of the booking venue.</p>
                  <p>We are changing the market-dynamics by giving this 'special privilege' to our Partymon(s) / User(s). But as is said,  “with great privileges comes great  responsibilities”. Hence, if the Partymon(s) / User(s) makes a booking through the "POA Mode”, and the Partymon(s) / User(s) does not turn-up/show-up at the venue to make the payment at the entry-point, then the following strict penalties shall be applied against the said Partymon(s) / User(s):</p>

                  <ul class="list">
                   <li>
                    <strong>5 Years Black-Listing from the Platforms:</strong><br>
                    <p>The POA as a 'mode of payment' would be taken-away from the defaulting Partymon(s) / User(s) for the next 5 (Five) years; and</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Reporting To RBI Towards Payment Defaults:</strong><br>
                    <p>We would have to report the non-payment of the defaulting Partymon(s) / User(s) to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which would adversely effect the defaulting Partymon(s) / User’s Credit Rating / Credit History when taking further credits from bank(s), such as, credit card limit / issuance or loans.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul> 

                <p>Hence, as mentioned above, "with great powers comes great responsibilities", therefore, our recommendation is that use "POA Mode" with great responsibility and enjoy the benefits of the same.</p>
